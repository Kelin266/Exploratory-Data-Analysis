-- ============================================================
-- Purpose of the Script:
-- This SQL script performs exploratory data analysis on the 
-- sales fact table. It calculates key business metrics such as 
-- total sales, total quantity sold, average selling price, 
-- number of orders, distinct products, and customer counts. 
-- It also consolidates these KPIs into a single result set 
-- for easier reporting and dashboard creation.

-- Retrieve all records from the sales fact table to get a 
-- complete view of the raw transactional data.

-- to identify duplicates or multiple entries per order.
